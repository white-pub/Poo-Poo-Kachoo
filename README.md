## Problem Statement

Each year, the US produces an estimated **6-8 million meat rabbits**, generating approximately **332 million pounds of waste**. This waste management challenge is significant due to:

- **Individual Waste Production**: A single rabbit produces around **0.13 lbs of waste per day** (about 150-200 droppings).
- **Labor Requirements**: In smaller setups, manual cleaning can take **20-30 minutes daily**, while in larger productions, this time and the physical demands increase, consuming substantial resources.

Our project aims to create an efficient waste management system to handle rabbit waste, reducing manual labor and optimizing time for rabbit producers.

## Objectives

- **Automate waste collection** to reduce daily cleaning time.
- **Minimize manual labor** required in rabbit production facilities.
- **Develop a scalable system** adaptable for various production sizes.

Our solution will be an innovative step toward sustainable, efficient waste management in the rabbit production industry.
